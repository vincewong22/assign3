The output files were generated by the following commands under Linux

  ./rsort < in1 > out1
  ./rsort < in2 > out2
  ./rsort < in > out
  ./rsort +n +s < in > out+n+s
  ./rsort +n -s < in > out+n-s
  ./rsort -n +s < in > out-n+s
  ./rsort -n -s < in > out-n-s
  ./rsort +s +n < in > out+s+n
  ./rsort +s -n < in > out+s-n
  ./rsort -s +n < in > out-s+n
  ./rsort -s -n < in > out-s-n
  ./rsort +s < in3 > out3+s
  ./rsort -s < in3 > out3-s
  ./rsort +n < in4 > out4+n
  ./rsort -n < in4 > out4-n

Note that all input & output files are in Unix format & that 
the above tests are not exhaustive.

You may be able to use the runtests script to run the tests in Linux or 
cygwin.  It assumes that your program is called rsort.exe in cygwin or rsort
in Linux.

The debug output for

./rsort < in

should consist of 37 #s, 74 %s & 75 @s.
